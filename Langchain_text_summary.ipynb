Ng has also made substantial contributions to the field of online education as the cofounder of both Coursera and DeepLearning.AI.[4] He has spearheaded many efforts to \"democratize deep learning\" teaching over 2.5 million students through his online courses.[5][2] He is one of the world's most famous and influential computer scientists being named one of Time magazine's 100 Most Influential People in 2012, and Fast Company's Most Creative People in 2014. In 2018, he launched and currently heads the AI Fund, initially a $175-million investment fund for backing artificial intelligence startups. He has founded Landing AI, which provides AI-powered SaaS products.[6]\n",

       "\"The main idea of the speed estimation is to track the vehicle's bounding box coordinates and time when it enters and exits a specified region. The distance between the start and finish lines of the region is calculated using a formula. The distance traveled by the vehicle within the region is determined using the Pythagorean theorem. The time the vehicle spends in the region is obtained by subtracting the exit time from the entry time. The real distance of the vehicle is calculated based on the defined start and finish lines. Finally, the speed of the vehicle is calculated by dividing the real distance by the time spent in the region.\""

       "'The article provides an introduction to Transformers, a neural network model that is effective for natural language processing tasks. It explains the concept of sequence-to-sequence learning and attention, which are key components of Transformers. The article then delves into the architecture of Transformers, highlighting the use of multi-head attention and feed-forward layers. It also discusses the training and inference processes for Transformers. Additionally, the article explores a use case of using Transformers for time-series forecasting. The results show that Transformers can be used for forecasting, but the accuracy decreases as the number of steps to forecast increases.'"
